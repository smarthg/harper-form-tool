## Uploading Existing Forms

If you have an existing insurance form in PDF format, you can upload it to automatically extract the information:

1. Click the "Upload Form" button in the top right corner
2. Select your PDF file from your device
3. Wait for the processing to complete
4. Review the extracted information
5. Click "Apply Changes" to populate the form with the extracted data

**Note**: The extraction process works best with clearly formatted insurance forms. Some fields may not be correctly extracted from poorly scanned or non-standard forms.

## Downloading Completed Forms

Once you've filled out the form (either manually or with voice commands), you can download it as a professional PDF:

1. Review all form fields to ensure they're complete and correct
2. Click the "Download Form" button
3. The PDF will be generated and downloaded to your device
4. Open the PDF with your preferred PDF viewer to review or print

## Activity History

The Activity Log keeps track of all the changes you make to the form:

- Each entry shows the command you gave, the field that was updated, and the new value
- The log is ordered chronologically with the most recent changes at the top
- This history helps you track what changes have been made to the form

## Tips for Better Voice Recognition

To get the best results with voice commands:

1. **Speak clearly and at a moderate pace**
2. **Use the suggested command structure** (verb + field + value)
3. **Minimize background noise** when using voice commands
4. **Position yourself close to your microphone**
5. **For better accuracy**, you can add your OpenAI API key in the settings (click the gear icon)
6. **Try alternative field names** if a command isn't recognized (e.g., "surname" instead of "last name")
7. **Check the transcript** to see if your speech was correctly recognized

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Commands Not Working

If your voice commands aren't being recognized:

1. **Check your microphone permissions**:
   - Make sure your browser has permission to access your microphone
   - Look for the microphone icon in your browser's address bar

2. **Verify your microphone is working**:
   - Try testing your microphone in another application
   - Check if your device has multiple microphones and select the correct one

3. **Try refreshing the page**:
   - Sometimes a simple refresh can resolve temporary issues

4. **Enhanced recognition with OpenAI**:
   - Click the gear icon in the Voice Interface
   - Enter your OpenAI API key for improved voice recognition

### PDF Upload Issues

If you're having trouble with PDF uploads:

1. **Check the file size**:
   - Ensure your PDF is under 5MB
   - Compress the PDF if necessary

2. **Verify the file format**:
   - Make sure you're uploading a valid PDF file
   - The application only accepts PDF format

3. **Try a different PDF**:
   - Some PDFs may be secured or have other restrictions
   - Try with a different PDF to see if the issue persists
